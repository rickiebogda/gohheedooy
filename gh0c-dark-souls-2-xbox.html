Pics: https://imgur.com/a/06awKn6. Does anyone still Hello, all you jolly Dark Souls 2 chaps. I've been wanting to get into the game recently, and I have the Xbox One system, but I understand that Dark Souls 2 is not a backwards compatible game. As such, I was wondering if there is a physical version of Scholar for the First Sin for Xbox One, and not just the digital version as I would much rather purchase physical. 
The Fight club will take place on Saturday 14th and possibly Sunday 15th March on Xbox 360. It should roughly start at 12PM - 1PM GMT unless I am running behind. It will be happening at Heides Tower of Flame near the Old Dragon slayer boss room. Name engraved ring = God of Blood SM range roughly = 2.75 million - 30 million I will be streaming the fight club on twitch at The Rules for the fight club are: 1) 2 pieces of Havels MAX (unless you are cos-playin. Here is a list of a big chunk of my collection. The rating system is in place to let you know, how hard, for me personally, an item is to trade. Everything (mostly)can be traded for with right offer :) HERE IS THE BIG LIST (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13acQ4TUrOMRbQAKDZ-plv9Xk00rpaoYiz2HrBhpZig8/edit?usp=docslist_api) PLEASE read the "READ ME" file in the doc, if you have any questions let me know CURRENT WANTS REALLY PRIORITIZING THESE ITEMS WII U GAMES. So I've been playing dark souls 2 on xbox one for awhile now and until yesterday the calibrations take 5 minuets to load then once on my character I can't see signs or invade people anyone know a reason 
Me and my friends have been playing ds2 Scholar of the first sin since release with no problems summoning. No suddenly we are not seeing any summon signs. I Uninstaller mine and reinstalled it and loaded up the game and seen summons then once I tried to connect with friends, no more summons. Please. Being a dark/demon souls virgin, which platform is best for these games? I have a good gaming PC along with a 360, and am not sure which platform the game was intended to be played. OK When I startup Dark Souls 2 it asks what profile is playing and then says "checking save data do not power off the console ." Know usually the screen where it says checking save data. only last about 10-20 seconds and then it proceeds to log me in the dark souls 2 servers. But this time I have been stuck on the screen for an hour and 30 minutes. I have tried quitting the game and restarting it, turning off the xbox, and even logging off my xbox profile. But ever time I start 
I really need a co op buddy to get through the sunken king dlc, can anyone come join me?? My Xbox name is Fadelessboss41. I can't invade in either the forest of the fallen Giants or heides tower of flame. There is a broken eye orb with a slash through it underneath me health bar what does it mean? I'm human and I meet all the requirements. I can't seem to connect to anyone with my blue eye orbs anywhere. I need help with the blue smelter demon in dark souls 2 xbox one in Iron Hallway Entrence on new game plus. My gamertag is Sublimesaint I request to summon people.

All of my games are CIB and I'm only looking for games that are also CIB! My biggest want right now is Skyrim for the switch but I'm also open to offers for the Switch If you need help with Dark Souls 1 or 2 Scholar of the first sin on Xbox one, I'll be happy to help. Gamertag is DarkLiveRyder. Hello guys! I'm thinking in buying DS2 for X1. I played the game years ago on PS3 and I would to like to play the SotFS edition, but this time with a friend. So. there's someone interested in play co-op campaign? P.S: I'm not a navite english speaker, but I can speak very well the language. 
I'm looking for a discord server for the first dark souls on xbox one maybe? (Original). I want a game similar to metroid prime or the souls games in that the story is filled with mysteries and the environments are breathtaking. Metroid prime 1 has always been my absolute favorite game because of this reason, and I love beautiful environment filled games like subnautica or dark souls/sekiro (Xbox one so haven’t played Bloodborne). Anyone want to help me with this area, plus more if you want? My soul memory is 300k. Lets kick this areas. </p>
