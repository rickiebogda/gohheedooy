                            <p> Hi all, I'm in the process of booking my tickets (round-trip to South Korea from the US), and had a quick question about the checked baggage weight limit for Delta Premium Select customers. From what it says on their website, "First Class, Delta Premium Select, and Delta One" customers are allowed to check two pieces of luggage weighing up to 70 lbs. However, further down the webpage, it says "Delta Premium Select customers are allowed 2 free bags (50lbs, 23kgs each)." Very confused as to which. 
Minor complaint, but god do I miss the exclamation points over the newly dropped gear in my inventory. One accidental mouse over and the ! is gone. Mods are even more difficult to sort through since I use the mouse wheel to scroll through them and the ! vanishes almost instantly. Of course this is only a problem for the hoarders like me that have 70 items in their bags and a full bank. Please please please - can I have the option to leave the ! on new inventory items until I click I'm camping yaks atm and got a second boy yak that I didn't want, and since I crashed some non-cannon users out of here earlier I figured I'd give it away. I almost gave away the Virile one (which was before the one I did give away in the inventory) even though I clicked on the second one, because apparently it'll put the first animal of that type in even if you click a specific one. So yeah, if you have multiple animals of the same type in your inventory and you want to keep a specific I've never modded anything before in my life, and I've recently decided to mod Skyrim. I've gotten Mod Organizer installed, I've gotten several mods to work, but for some reason I can't add Immersive Armors or Immersive Weapons or Pure Waters. I've started to consider the fact that I need Script Extender but I seriously can't figure out how to install this thing. I'm using Steam and Skyrim Special Addition, and I couldn't get the mods I wanted on Steam. So. Do I actually Let's try this again, since the first post was deleted without having a log (yet, many other posts exist without logs). \ sigh\ I am attempting to view the movie "Captain Marvel" via Seren, and for whatever reason it will find many different sources and then report back that there are no sources for this item. I was finally able to find a site that will let me paste the log, so I will attach that. So, in order for my post not to get deleted, here is the information: Platform: I was assigned through the HUH lottery a view date of May 21st and a select date on the following day. I'm an incoming grad student, and I really liked some of the housing options that had 3+ people (since the flats were better and the overall expenses lower compared to singles). But this select date seems, well, fucking terrible. It seems like I'm going to get fucked by HUH, with only super-expensive units or super-terrible units available so late in the lottery. Am I thinking rightly I have been trying to see Pet Sematary for the past 3 days (and I live in an area with many theaters) and every time I get that message. The Motherboard 
I was able to get good tickets. I wanted front row or at least an end. My husband likes his space. I was stuck in the queue for a while even though I was sitting there waiting Speedtest data usage shows up on my account. It started about 2 weeks ago. (no VPN) I have TMO One TI plan with KicKback. If you will run the Speedtest about 15 times, than you will lose your KicKback discount. be careful. According to John Legere, Speedtest will never counts against to your data usage. Looks like it has silently been changed . I filed a ticket, please do the same. \-------- update: I got 2 tickets and an update: valid problem, they are working on it I really </p>
